  abstract = {Retail salespersons play a critical role in the success of a retail establishment. This paper focuses on improving the performance of retail salespeople by developing a process by which they can better determine the wants and needs of their customers. A series of questions is defined based on the sensation seeking and uniqueness seeking motives by observing the correlations between the items from the instruments constructed to measure these concepts with innovative behavior. Such knowledge will aid salespersons in the selection of products and/or features which should be highlighted to best satisfy the individual's needs.}

  abstract = {Investigated the relationship between perceived status in politics and judged physical stature. 177 Ss were interviewed. Comparison of estimated heights of Canadian federal party leaders before and after the 1988 federal election indicated that the losers, Broadbent and Turner, were judged to be shorter afterwards, while the winner, Mulroney, was judged taller. Although the relationship between status and judged height has previously been demonstrated, this result indicates that it is dynamic (i.e., election outcomes alter rated tallness). A gender effect also was noted. (French abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {This study examined the relationship of career mentoring to the promotions and compensation received by 404 early career managers and professionals working in a variety of organizations. The results indicate that with a number of variables controlled, career mentoring was related to both promotion rate and total compensation. The results also support the conclusion that career-oriented mentoring has a greater relationship with promotion rate for people from the highest-level socioeconomic backgrounds than for those from lower-level backgrounds. We provide several explanations for the effects of career mentoring on early career progress and suggest a number of areas for future research on mentoring and other developmental relationships.}
